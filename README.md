Code Base for Paper "A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Modeling Arrival Times in Dynamic Environments" by L. Kirchdorfer and K. Ã–zdemir et al. (2024)

## Introduction

**Abstract**

Simulation is a critical tool for analyzing, improving, and redesigning organizational processes and their supporting information systems. A key component of simulation is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern of new case entries into a process. Accurate case-arrival modeling is essential for reliable simulations, yet existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation} (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival times by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations, and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability. Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is considerably more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining runtime efficiency.

**Key features:**

- **AT-KDE (Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation):** A divide-and-conquer method that identifies and models multiple temporal scales (global, weekly, and intraday) to produce highly accurate and scalable arrival time simulations.
- **Improved Modeling Techniques:** In addition to AT-KDE, the code supports other baseline methods, including mean, exponential, Prophet-based, and standard KDE models. This allows for easy benchmarking and comparison.
- **Robust and Efficient:** Tested on 20 diverse processes, AT-KDE significantly improves accuracy and reliability compared to existing approaches, without compromising computational efficiency.
